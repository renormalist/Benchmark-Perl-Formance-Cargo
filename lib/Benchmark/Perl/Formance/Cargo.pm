Some contained files come from the SpamAssassin Public Corpus which
includes the following note regarding the use of the messages:

  - All headers are reproduced in full.  Some address obfuscation has taken
    place, and hostnames in some cases have been replaced with
    "spamassassin.taint.org" (which has a valid MX record).  In most cases
    though, the headers appear as they were received.
  
  - All of these messages were posted to public fora, were sent to me in the
    knowledge that they may be made public, were sent by me, or originated as
    newsletters from public news web sites.
  
  - relying on data from public networked blacklists like DNSBLs, Razor, DCC
    or Pyzor for identification of these messages is not recommended, as a
    previous downloader of this corpus might have reported them!
  
  - Copyright for the text in the messages remains with the original senders.
